RomRaider logger and ECU definitions for ms43 - Note you must have atleast Romraider 0.9.4!!

The ECU definitions have been created based on the excellent work by the ms4x dev team (ms4x.net) who created definitions for TunerPro. I have started porting these across to RomRaider.

Also now includes support for those running the ms4x extended load binary.

I will only be updating definitions for v430069 which is the latest version, and only for partial reads.
Should anyone else like to contribute

a) other versions, or 

b) full flash locations

Please feel free to submit your additions for merging into the master branch

The logger definition has been created based on my work in uncovering the custom telegram method which allows faster polling rates and selecting multiple parameters not previously available under standard logging protocols.

If my work proves helpful to you, donations are appreciated. I will contribute a percentage of any donations to the ms4x dev team as without them, the ecu definitions would not be at the maturity that they currently are.
